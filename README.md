### Background 

The overarching goal of this project is to develop a neural network capable of classifying the genre of an inputted mp3 file. The inputted mp3 file is first converted to a mel-spectrogram which will then be passed through a neural network to predict the genre. The scope of the genres is condensed to one of 7 genres:
  * Hip Hop
  * Pop
  * RnB
  * Rock
  * Latin
  * EDM
  * Country

### Technologies Used
  * Python 3.x
  * PyTorch 1.6.0
